This C# Problem will help you practice the basic concepts of Class, Object, Method, and Property. Follow the steps carefully and write your code in a new Console Application.

# Task 1: Create a Car Class                                                           

Step 1. Create a class named Car with the following properties:

  • Brand – name of the car brand

  • Model – model of the car (e.g., Corolla, Camry, RAV4)

  • Year (int) – manufacturing year of the car

  • Mileage (int) – total distance the car has traveled (in kilometer) 

Step 2. Add a method called Drive(int kilometers) that:

  • Increases the Mileage by the given kilometers.

  • Prints:

          Car [Brand] [Model] has driven [kilometers] km. Total mileage: [Mileage] km.

 

 

# Task 2: Create Objects of the Class                                                      

Step 1. In the Main method:

  • Create two different Car objects (e.g., Toyota, Tesla).

  • Set their properties with different values.

Step 2. Call the Drive method on both cars (different kilometers for each). Expected Output (Example):

  Car Toyota Corolla has driven 50 km. Total mileage: 50 km. Car Tesla Model 3 has driven 120 km. Total mileage: 120 km. Car Toyota Corolla has driven 30 km. Total mileage: 80 km.


# Task 3                                                                                                                                   

Add a method ShowCarInfo() that prints:

Car Info: Brand - [Brand], Model - [Model], Year - [Year], Mileage - [Mileage]
